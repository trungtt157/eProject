        <h2>Dental Health of Kid</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>When should a child first be seen by a dentist?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>1 year old. It is generally recommended that an infant be seen by a dentist by 1 year of age or within 6 months after the first tooth comes in.</p>
        </div>    
    

        <h2>Oral Health</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Halitosis is the medical term for oral condition?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Bad breath, medically called halitosis, can result from poor dental hygiene and may be a sign of other health problems. Bad breath can also be made worse by the types of foods you eat and other unhealthy lifestyle habits.</p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Poor dental health is linked to many serious diseases and conditions. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>True. Some studies have linked common oral problems to illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, premature birth, osteoporosis, and even Alzheimer's disease. In most cases, the strength and exact nature of the link is unclear, but researchers suggest that dental health is important for preserving overall health.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Black hairy tongue is a deadly oral disease. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>False. The name -- black hairy tongue -- may sound scary, but the condition is actually harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Oral cancer that is caught early is treatable and curable. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>True. Oral cancer presents as a mouth sore that doesn't go away and can be accompanied by unexplained numbness in the face, mouth, or neck. There may be problems chewing, speaking, or swallowing. Don't let fear keep you from the doctor -- oral cancer that is caught early is treatable and curable.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>How often should I replace my toothbrush?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Every 2 to 3 months. The American Dental Association recommends throwing out your toothbrush every three to four months. If the bristles become frayed, you're sick, or you have a weak immune system, throw it out even more often. If you use an electric toothbrush, throw out the head as often as you'd discard a disposable toothbrush.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What type of toothbrush and toothpaste should I use?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Buy toothbrushes with soft bristles. Medium and firm ones can damage teeth and gums. Use soft pressure, for 2 minutes, two times a day.</p>
            <p>Both powered and manual toothbrushes clean teeth well. Manual brushes with mixed bristle heights or angled bristles clean better than those with all flat, even bristles. Powered toothbrushes may be easier if you have trouble using your hands.</p>
            <p>Set a reminder to replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months. Toss it sooner if the bristles look bent or splayed out. Bent bristles don't clean as well. (They're also a sign you may be brushing too hard).</p>
            <p>Most toothpastes will clear away bacteria growth and acids from food and drinks. Toothpastes with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance always have fluoride, which strengthens and protects teeth. If you want a non-fluoride option, stores carry toothpastes and powders made with natural ingredients that don't have ADA testing and approval.</p>
            <p>If cold or hot food or drinks make you cringe, pick a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and let your dentist know.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What are early signs of dental trouble?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Visit a dentist if you have any of these issues or see your child having trouble chewing or complaining of soreness:</p>
            <p>- Mouth sores</p>
            <p>- Jaw pain</p>
            <p>- Redness</p>
            <p>- Swollen face or gums</p>
            <p>- Tooth sensitivity</p>
            <p>- Broken teeth</p>
            <p>- Dry mouth</p>
            <p>- Bleeding gums</p>
            <p>- Bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth</p>
            <p>Getting checked out right away prevents more serious problems and infections.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion"><b>Why do I need dental exams?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Regular exams help spot trouble early to prevent bigger and more costly treatments later.</p>
            <p>A dental hygienist will start by cleaning buildup from your teeth. Then the dentist will probe spots on the surfaces and near the gumline with special tools. If it's been a while between appointments, you may have some sore and sensitive areas.</p>
            <p>You should get an exam every 6 months, or more often if your dentist recommends it. Find one who makes you feel at ease and lets you know what to expect. Often the dread of seeing the dentist turns to big relief when the visit is over and you have a care plan set up. Being positive as a parent can help your kids overcome any of their fears.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Are dental X-rays safe and needed?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Medical and dental experts study the use of X-rays and set limits for their safety. Your dentist should take as few as possible. Sometimes dentists may recommend X-rays to diagnose a special problem. Advancements in technology means today's digital X-rays release much less radiation and are safer than in the past.</p>
            <p>Expect to get them during a first exam after not seeing a dentist for a while. This helps check tooth and gum health. If you have gum disease, the dentist may want pictures every 6 months. For regular check-ups, it's about every 2 years, depending on your dentist's plan.</p>
            <p>Kids have more X-rays done than adults because their teeth are changing and because they get cavities more easily.</p>

        <h2>Tooth</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>What causes tooth decay?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Acid. Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches) are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities, or dental caries.</p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>Tooth loss is an inevitable part of aging. True or False?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>False. "Although tooth loss is common, it's not an inevitable part of aging," says Richard H. Price, DDS, a retired dentist in Newton, Mass., and spokesman for the American Dental Association. "Teeth do not die a natural death -- we kill them. Exactly how do we do that? In short, by disease or trauma," he says.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Do I really need to floss?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There's no getting around the need to get around your teeth daily with dental floss. It clears food and plaque from between teeth and under the gumline. If you don't, plaque hardens into tartar, which forms wedges and widens the space between teeth and gums, causing pockets. Over time, gums pull away and teeth loosen.</p>
            <p>Either waxed or unwaxed floss will do the job. Using floss picks or interdental brushes is another easy option.</p>
        </div>
    

        <h2>Gum</h2>
    
        <button class="accordion"><b>What is the best way to prevent gum (periodontal) disease?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Remove plaque. Gum disease can be prevented by removing plaque. Plaque removal can be easily accomplished by thoroughly brushing and flossing your teeth daily. Regular dental check-ups (every 6-12 months) can detect early signs of gum disease.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Which of the following usually precede(s) gum disease (periodontal disease)?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Gingivitis. Gingivitis (gum inflammation) usually precedes periodontitis (gum disease). In the early stage of gingivitis, bacteria in plaque buildup causes the gums to become inflamed (red and swollen) and often easily bleed during tooth brushing. Although the gums may be irritated, the teeth are still firmly planted in their sockets. No irreversible bone or other tissue damage has occurred at this stage.</p>
